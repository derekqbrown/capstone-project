To load new data, these folders will need to contain the presorted images used in the classifications. The dataset used to train the original model was a subset of the dataset found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images  
However, with some tweaking, the model could be trained on any dataset. With some simple modifications, the dataset could be used to classify images of fruit, for example. 
To do so, the folders "Positive" and "Negative" would be replaced with the categories for each fruit, and the code in train.py would need to be adjusted by changing 'CLASSES = ['positive', 'negative']' on line 12 to 'CLASSES = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana']' to include each category.
